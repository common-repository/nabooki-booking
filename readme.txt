== Installation ==

**How do I set it up?**

For manual installation of the plugin follow these steps:

1. Upload the (unzipped) nabooki plugin directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

To install the plugin via the WordPress Plugin Directory, log in to your Wordpress site then follow these steps:

1. On your Dashboard click the 'Plugins' and 'Add new'
2. Search for the “nabooki booking plugin”
3. Click the Install Now link

Activate your plugin from the widgets menu (Appearance > Widgets admin)

Initial setup:

1. Once the plugin has been installed, click 'A'ctivate Plugin' under the Plugins menu.
2. Navigate to ’Settings’ in the left side menu and select nabooki.
3. Link your nabooki account and then you will be able to create nabooki widgets.
4. You will be able to create multiple booking widgets or book now buttons, allowing you to create an “all services” booking tool, “single service” or a “service page” booking tool. Single service booking tools are great for service specific pages on your WordPress site.

Add the book now button or booking tool to your sidebar or on any page by using the short tag [nabooki-button] for the book now button or [nabooki-widget] for the booking tool. When you create single service booking tools, a unique identifier number will be created within the tag.
If you are using WordPress v5, use the shortcodes block with the Gutenberg editor to correctly add your shortcodes to your posts.
